Welcome to the Chemistry Calculator! In this device you will be able to calculate molar mass, grams of a molecule, moles of a molecule and molarity. The first column you see is the single conversion column. Each one of these operations only requires one molecule. Molar mass calculates the molar mass, moles to grams calculates grams given the amount of moles and grams to moles calculates moles given the amount of grams. The second column you see is the double conversion column. Each one of these operations requires two molecules. Moles to grams calculates the amount of grams in a substance given the amount of moles and the conversion factor. If you click help while on a specific operation you will receive specific instructions on how to proceed.
This is molar mass. Enter the molecule into the text box that says "Enter Molecule." To write atoms write their atomic symbol with proper capitalization. If there are multiple of one atom put the number directly after the atomic symbol. Do not use parentheses as that will not work. Press the button "Calculate Molar Mass" and you will receive your value in the adjacent text box.
This is single molecule moles to grams. Enter the molecule into the text box that says "Enter Molecule." To write atoms write their atomic symbol with proper capitalization. If there are multiple of one atom put the number directly after the atomic symbol. Do not use parentheses as that will not work. Enter the amount of moles of that molecule into the text box that says "Enter Moles." Press the button "Calculate Grams" and you will receive your value in the adjacent text box.
This is single molecule grams to moles. Enter the molecule into the text box that says "Enter Molecule." To write atoms write their atomic symbol with proper capitalization. If there are multiple of one atom put the number directly after the atomic symbol. Do not use parentheses as that will not work. Enter the amount of grams of that molecule into the text box that says "Enter Grams." Press the button "Calculate Moles" and you will receive your value in the adjacent text box.
This is double molecule moles to grams. Enter the first molecule into the text box that says "Enter Molecule 1". Enter the second molecule into the text box that says "Enter Molecule 2". To write atoms write their atomic symbol with proper capitalization. If there are multiple of one atom put the number directly after the atomic symbol. Do not use parentheses as that will not work. Enter the amount of moles of the first molecule into the text box that says "Enter Moles." Enter the conversion factor into the two text boxes that follow "Conversion Factor." Both numbers need to be whole numbers. The first text box corresponds to molecule 1 and the second text box corresponds to molecule 2. Press the button "Calculate Grams" and you will receive your value in the adjacent text box.
