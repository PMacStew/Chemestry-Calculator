Welcome to the Chemistry Calculator! In this device you will be able to calculate molar mass, grams of a molecule, moles of a molecule and molarity. The first column you see is the single conversion column. Each one of these operations only requires one molecule. Molar mass calculates the molar mass, moles to grams calculates grams given the amount of moles and grams to moles calculates moles given the amount of grams.
